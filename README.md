# stix-pattern-evaluator
This project is a STIX v2.1 pattern compiler and evaluator written in Java 8 using the [ANTLR 4](https://www.antlr.org/) language parser. The ANTLR grammar is based on the [cti-stix2-json-schemas](https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas) with some minor changes. It is still very much in an alpha stage of development.

This was originally designed for another project of mine that has since been abandoned. I am repurposing the code for public use, which means there will be a lack of authoritative documentation until I find the time to migrate the existing documentation over. Once I have finished rewriting the unit tests, I will work on documentation.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
